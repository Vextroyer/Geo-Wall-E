On this file some syntax rules are described for G#.

Rules
1- Constants cant be redeclared. Therefore any instruccion that associates identifiers to values(create variables) must be checked to enforce this rule.
2- Constants cant be assigned an empty expression.
3- A variable cant be declared twice on the same scope.
4- Variables must be declared before being used.
